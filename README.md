# exomoons

These are Python tools for creating and displaying exorings and exomoon artefacts (rings) in circumplanetary meterial,
with the main goal to generate ligh curves.
This code is based on and adapted from Matthew Kenworthy's GitHub repository "exorings", which in turn is based on
the paper by Kenworthy and Mamajek (2015).

Full licence can be found in "LICENCE.txt".


Currently I am bringing the code up to speed with Python 3 and trying to restructure it so that it is easier to use
and understand.
